# CLJSS

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/dehli/cljss.svg)](https://clojars.org/dehli/cljss)

This is a Clojurescript wrapper of [JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss).

If you want to use this wrapper, you must compile your source code with:

```
{:install-deps true}
```

Note that `:advanced` compilation currently does not work.

Please see the demo for an example of how to use it (documentation to be added).
